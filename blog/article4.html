                          As the world increasingly visualizes a digital future, powered by electric cars and sophisticated AI, there is something much more fundamental being ignored. Even today, 820 Million people in the world remain hungry, and the level of undernourishment has remained constant at 11% over the past three years, according to the The State of Hunger report. In fact, 1.3 billion people or 17.2% of the world population have experienced food insecurity.
                         </p>

                        <p>
                          What is striking about the Zero Hunger Sustainable Development Goal is that hunger is not a problem caused by lack of food, it is primarily caused by lack of access to nutritious and sufficient food. Especially in developing countries, the problem is caused by a lack of supply chains and logistics which fail to provide food to those who need it the most, even though the food production is enough to cater to the needs of the population. Further, the problem is not confined to developing countries, even high-income countries suffer from lack of regular access to nutritious food. Thus, the problem includes both those who are undernourished and malnourished, with obesity contributing to 4 million deaths globally. This problem is the most acute for school-age children and adults, who lack consumption of fresh produce and are not physically active. Another complication is the gender gap in food insecurity. In all the continents, food insecurity is more prevalent among women than men, with the largest inequality found in Latin America.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Part of the problem can also be solved by legislation to limit consumption of harmful fats, salts and sugars. For example, Singapore became the first country to ban ads for the most unhealthy sugary drinks, in order to combat diabetes in the country. All is not bleak, though. The number of stunted children has declined by 10% over the past ten years but we would still fall short of the target of 50% reduction in the number of stunted children, with whatever progress so far varying in every region.
                        </p>

                        <p>India presents a strange and rather worrisome quandary with regard hunger. The country produces enough sufficient food to feed the population, and while the number of undernourished people has fallen following years of sustained effort, the country is yet unable to provide access to food for a large number of its people, with women and children being the worst affected.</p>

                        <p>As per the FAO an alarming 194.4 Million people suffer from undernourishment in the country. This surmounts to nearly 15% of the total population of India. Dwelling in further into these statistics more than half of the women in the reproductive age are anaemic, more than a third of the children (37.9%) of the children under the age of 5 are stunted and a fifth of them suffer from wasting (Their weight being too low for their height). Comparing some of these statistics to the global scenario India ranked 97 out of 188 developing countries in the Global Hunger Index.</p>

                        <p>Thus, for India as a country the SDG of Ending hunger is of paramount importance, India’s large demographic dividend and large population can be hardly considered an asset if a large section of them do not have a belly of food and enjoy what one can only be considered one of the most basic human rights. The government has taken a few steps in this regard. One of these being the National Food security Act in 2013 and aims to cover 80 Crore or two thirds of India’s population. India’s mid-day meal scheme and Antodaya Anna Yojana are also steps in the right direction but to affect significant change some impetus also needs to be shown by the private sector.</p>

                        <p>
                          World Business Council for Sustainable development initiated a two-year project 'The Business and Sustainable development commission'. In one of the report, 'Better Business, Better World', it stated that achieving the SDG's could unlock 12 trillion dollars per year in terms of business value and 380 million jobs. The most significant share would come from Food and agriculture(2.3 trillion dollars), Cities and urban Mobility(3.7 trillion dollars), Energy and Materials(4.3 trillion dollars), and Health and Wellbeing(1.8 trillion dollars). The report suggests four critical pillars from business perspectives, along with which the implications of SDGs need to be understood.</p>
                          <p>1. Risk of Inaction</p>
                              <p>2. Capturing Opportunities</p>
                                <p>3. Governance and Transparency</p>
                                <p>4. The need for collaboration</p>
                              <p>Achieving 'zero hunger' is primarily relevant for companies in the food and drink production, processing, and retail business.</p>

                        <p>
                          <b>Risk of Inaction</b>
                          Doing nothing is a costly option. SDGs focusses on the future at the International, national, and regional level failing to integrate could lead to long-term regulatory risk. Also, there is a threat of falling behind in the era of the disruptive market, if we couldn't keep pace with the trend.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          <b>Capturing opportunities</b>
                          There is enormous potential for firms that can align SDG goals into their business model. In food production, it can link to supporting the development of digital platforms to allow farmers to share information.
                          Firms vocal about their SDG policies and how it will help the government to achieve the SDG goals are likely to be able to get an active license to operate and to differentiate themselves from competitors.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          <b>Governance and Transparency</b>
                          More work is needed in communicating the SDGs into the language of corporate governance. There is a need to create a robust performance metric to monitor and compare the risks in a clear and meaningful way.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          <b>The need for collaboration</b>
                          SDG goals are beyond the reach of any one company. Firms need to collaborate to come up with solutions. This can be done at sectoral level, cross-sectoral and public-private partnerships.
                        </p>


                        <p>
                          There are five major targets of the zero-hunger goal. Organizations around the globe have taken steps to try to address some of these through initiatives and incorporating various checks in organizational processes. Aligning their actions with business implications is key to ensuring growth whilst maintaining a sustainable market to address. Further, we discuss a few targets with respect to some large multinational firms and how certain business implications could have motivated them to take up the cause of hunger.</p>

                        <p>
                          DuPont came up with the goal of developing 4000 new products by the end of 2020 with an investment outlay of over 10 billion dollars into research & development. Being a chemical company, they have looked at various solutions for reducing crop disease and enhancing productivity, along with developing chemicals for growing crops with higher nutrients. These would be aimed at the production of food items and would help achieve the first target of ending hunger along with ensuring access of nutritious and sufficient food to people, especially those in poorer regions of the world and infants. They are working towards educating people on the importance of sustainable agriculture and food production along with its impact on a growing population. One of the major reasons DuPont as a firm has gone forward with such an initiative is the fact that their business closely aligns with the hunger goal, in terms of their involvement with chemicals. This let’s them explore a new market in terms of a wide range of products, while gaining investor confidence due to being sustainable and thus ensuring higher growth levels as a result. So as to speak the two major implications which DuPont has addressed are the implication of inaction and capturing new opportunities.
                        </p>

                          Philips Healthcare Services took up the task of combatting micronutrient deficiency by committing micronutrient powder supply to children in the age band of 6-59 months in Kenya. The aim was to provide around 150,000 infants with the MNP powder by the end of 2018. Alarming numbers in terms of number of children suffering from micronutrient deficiencies was one of the motivating factors to take up this cause in collaboration with Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), which works with many countries and governments to come up with policies aimed at distribution and availability of MNP and DSM nutritional products, a firm that manufactures and procures MNP at affordable prices. This is a clear of collaboration with multiple partners on a global level to ensure achieving an objective which embodies the second target of Zero Hunger; ending malnutrition along with achieving pre-decided targets on children with stunting growth and wasting in children under the age of 5.
                        </p>

                          MasterCard has been working on delivery of food assistance to people living in refugee camps in collaboration with the World Food Programme. They have recently introduced a product called 2Kuze in the east African marketspace with the aim of increasing financial inclusivity by digitizing the entire supply chain on the agricultural sector. This would help connect small scale farmers, middlemen, eventual consumers and banks on a platform, thereby allowing for access to information, markets and financial services to farmers along with providing for transparency in payments. This would help farmers capture greater value from their produce thereby ensuring economic growth and help achieve the target of increase agricultural productivity as well as incomes of smallholder producers as well as providing them with resources, knowledge, markets and opportunities to grow outside the farm space. MasterCard is working in unison with CafeDirect Producers Foundation, an NGO working with 300,000 small scale farmers globally. Growth in the market would help MasterCard capture a new geography to service its products to in the future, while ensuring trust in the company due to its initial activities with regard to the future consumers.
